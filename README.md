# Workshop 1: Introducing JavaScipt with P5.js

Make sure you‚Äôre working in pairs - on a single laptop. You‚Äôll be **pair programming**. In pair programming, there are two roles - **driver** and **navigator**.

The **driver** is at the keyboard. They‚Äôre responsible for typing and figuring out syntax. They shouldn‚Äôt make decisions though! That‚Äôs the responsibility of the **navigator**. They make decisions, and ask the driver to implement them.

Start by forking this repo:
![fork button](https://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/fork_button.jpg)

Forking creates a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account. Add your partner as a collaborator by going to 'Settings' > 'Collaborators & teams' and entering their GitHub username in the 'Collaborators' box. That means you'll both have access to the repo.

Next, we need to clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5.git
cd di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5
npm install
```

We‚Äôll be working with some software called P5. P5 is a **JavaScript library** for drawing shapes - it‚Äôs used for making simple games and cool generative art.

For each of the **bold** questions below:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em;">
  <span style="display: inline-block; padding: 0 1em">üó£ Discuss</span>
  <span style="display: inline-block; padding: 0 1em">üë©‚Äçüíª Change</span>
  <span style="display: inline-block; padding: 0 1em">üëÄ Observe</span>
  <span style="display: inline-block; padding: 0 1em">üîÑ Repeat</span>
</p>

1. **üó£ Discuss** the question with your partner
1. **üë©‚Äçüíª Change the code** - what do you expect your changes to do?
1. **üëÄ Observe the results** - what happened when you ran your code? How did it differ from your expectations
1. **üîÑ Repeat** - keep discussing, changing, and running the code until you feel you understand it

**The aim of this workshop is _exploration_, hopefully leading to _understanding_. It‚Äôs really important that you _take your time_.
The questions below are _guidelines_, meant to prompt your _curiosity_.
If you can‚Äôt answer a question, use a search engine or ask someone nearby.
Don‚Äôt move on until you _fully understand_ what‚Äôs happening.**

**Explore and have fun! Be curious!**

# Setup

Now you've got the repo cloned and installed, we need to start it up:

```sh
npm start
```

This runs a web server - a little program that your browser can connect to so that the files you write in this project can run in there. Now, when you visit http://localhost:5000/, you'll see all your files right there.

Open the workshop folder in your editor. In VSCode, choose File > Open and select the folder - _not any of the files inside it_. You should see all the workshop files in the left-hand file pane.

Open this file - README.md - in your editor. Make notes in here about everything you do. If you don't know the answer to a question, it's your job to experiment with the code to see what you can find out.

# Sketch A

Open the `part-a` sketch in your browser, and open `part-a/sketch.js` in your editor. The code in `sketch.js` is what's running on the page. Every time you make a change in `sketch.js`, you need to save the file (ctrl-S or cmd-S) and refresh your web browser (ctrl-r or cmd-r) to see the change.

---

Look at these lines:

```js
var r = 255
var g = 80
var b = 0
```

**What might these lines do?**

**What happens if you change the numbers?**

**What numbers are allowed / What numbers have an effect?**

Look at this line:

```js
createCanvas(400, 400)
```

**What does createCanvas do?**

**What happens if you change the numbers?**

**What numbers are allowed/what numbers have an effect?**

**What happens if you add/remove a number?**

**Can you guess what the `function setup() {` part does? What happens if you change the name of setup?**

Look at this line:

```js
background(r, g, b)
```

**What does background do?**

**What happens if you change the order of the letters in background? What does this tell you about how the computer uses them?**

**What happens if you change the number of letters?**

**What happens if you change the letters for different ones?**

# Sketch B

Open the `part-b` sketch in your browser, and open `part-b/sketch.js` in your editor.

Read the code and play with the sketch in your browser.

Look at these lines:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(0, 0, 0)
}
```

**What does setup do?**

**What do `{` `}` mean? What happens if you remove one?**

**What do the numbers in `background(0, 0, 0)` do? What happens when you change them? How is this different from Sketch A?**

Now look at these lines:

```js
function draw() {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
}
```

**What does draw do?**

Now look at:

```js
fill(255, 0, 0)
```

**What do these numbers do? What happens when you change them?**

**What does fill mean? What happens if you change it to stroke?**

**What happens if you remove (or comment out) this line? What about if you include both fill and stroke on seperate lines?**

Now look at this line:

```js
ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
```

**What does `ellipse` do?**

**What happens if you change the numbers?**

**What do `mouseX` and `mouseY` mean?**

**What happens if you change the order of the items between the `(` `)`?**

---

**What happens if you add `background(0)` after `draw() {`?
Why?**

Replace the ellipse with a triangle. Use https://p5js.org/reference/ (the 2D primitives section) to help.

Play around with the sketch - how else can you change it?

# Sketch C

Open the `part-c` sketch in your browser, and open `part-c/sketch.js` in your editor.

Read the code, then play with the sketch and observe what happens - try clicking the mouse on the sketch.

Look at:

```js
if (mouseIsPressed) {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
} else {
  fill(0, 255, 0)
}
```

**What does `mouseIsPressed` mean?**

**What happens if you change `mouseIsPressed` to `keyIsPressed`?** You‚Äôll need to click on the sketch so it registers keyboard events ‚Äì use the ctrl key if you have issues with the keyboard.

**What does if / else do?**

**What happens if you remove the { } or ( )? Why?**

**What happens if you change 255 to mouseX ? Why?**

**Remove the outline of the circle. Use Google and the P5.js reference to help you.**

# Challenge

In your pairs, take the code in sketch c and adapt it into a simple paint program. The user should be able

- click and drag to paint on the screen
- press keys on the keyboard to choose a colour
  - e.g. pressing ‚Äòr‚Äô changes the paint colour to red, pressing ‚Äòg‚Äô changes the paint colour to green.

Use this code as a starting point:

```js
if (keyIsPressed) {
  if (key == 'r') {
    // set paint colour to red
  }
  if (key == 'g') {
    // set paint colour to green
  }
  // add more keys/colours
}
```

**Document your process in this file.**

## Extension

- Change the shape of the brush (explore other shapes like squares or triangles) based on a key pressed
- Change the size of the brush based on a key pressed.
